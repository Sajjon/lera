# What?

`lera` is a set of procmacros (own [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)), build scripts (build, bindgen, post-bindgen) allowing you to generate ready-to-use ViewModels for [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/swiftui/) and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/compose) in pure Rust only.

> [!NOTE]
> The vision of lera is to be able to build iOS apps in SwiftUI and Android apps in Jetpack compose by writing **only UI** code natively (in Swift/Kotlin) with **all logic written in Rust**, in one place.

# Why?

[UniFFI](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs) is amazing (this software is built in top of it!), however, it does not (yet) support `uniffi::viewmodel` (or similar), and even with support of `@Observable` annotations for `uniffi::Object` UniFFI does not export any Swift state as stored properties which SwiftUI could observe, nor any `: ViewModel()` inheritance nor `StateFlow` for Jetpack compose in Kotlin generated code.

`lera` writes ViewModels which can be "observed" by SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose, ensuring the view updates according to `state`, and state is always up-to-date with changes made through input from views, and also changes made internally from within Rust itself (e.g. a background task in Rust which automatically increases a counter).

# Usage

macOS is assumed. You can surely make this work on Linux too, if you do, I welcome a PR with updated guides!

# Demo

See demo / example in [`example`](example) folder, scroll down for video recording of SwiftUI and Android demo apps.

## Rust side

Source code can be found in [`example/rust`](example/rust)

This is **all** you have to do in Rust land, in terms of Rust code.

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Default)]
#[lera::state]
pub struct CounterState {
    pub count: i64,
}

#[lera::model(state = CounterState)]
pub struct Counter {}

#[lera::api]
impl Counter {
    pub fn increment_button_tapped(self: &Arc<Self>) {
        self.mutate(|state| {
            state.count += 1;
        });
    }
    pub fn decrement_button_tapped(self: &Arc<Self>) {
        self.mutate(|state| {
            state.count -= 1;
        });
    }
    pub fn reset_button_tapped(self: &Arc<Self>) {
        self.mutate(|state| {
            state.count = 0;
        });
    }

    /// Can take args and return values
    pub fn tell_full_name(&self, first_name: &str, last_name: &str) -> String {
        format!("{} {}", first_name, last_name)
    }
}
```

This is the simplest demo I've made, but I've also managed to create a background task in Rust which periodically increments the counter, and that state change propagates back to Swift thanks to the callback pattern.

## Swift side

Swift package can found in [`example/apple`](example/apple).

### App demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beb65fc6-b913-4859-ab9b-adb32ccb3722

SwiftUI example in [`example/apple/app`](example/apple/app) uses Swift package in [`example/apple`](example/apple) as a local dependency.

This is how you use the by-`lera`-generated `CounterViewModel`:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import ModelsFromRust

public struct CounterView: View {
    private let model: CounterViewModel

    public init(model: CounterViewModel = .init()) {
        self.model = model
    }

    public var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Count: \(model.count)")

            Button("Increment") {
                model.incrementButtonTapped()
            }

            Button("Decrement") {
                model.decrementButtonTapped()
            }

            Button("Reset") {
                model.resetButtonTapped()
            }
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

### Swift Generated by `lera`

Lera was used to generate a Swift package in [`example/apple`](example/apple). See below what it generates for you.

The Swift code forwards actions from Swift to Rust, and any state changes occurring either directly as an effect of the action or state change happening internally inside of Rust (e.g. a background task) will all propagate back to Swift and to SwiftUI View (thanks to `@Observable`).

```swift
// MARK: CounterViewModel
extension CounterState {
    public init() {
        self = newDefaultCounterState()
    }
}
@Observable
@dynamicMemberLookup
public final class CounterViewModel: @unchecked Sendable {
    /// This is state, set by listener
    private var state: CounterState

    @ObservationIgnored
    private let model: Counter

    @ObservationIgnored
    private let listener: CounterStateChangeListener

    private init(state: CounterState, listener: CounterStateChangeListener) {
        self.state = state
        self.listener = listener
        self.model = Counter(state: state, listener: listener)
    }

    public convenience init(
        state: CounterState = CounterState()
    ) {
        let listener = Listener()
        self.init(state: state, listener: listener)
        listener.add(forwarder: Listener.Forwarder { [weak self] newState in
            print("Swift forwarder got new state")
            self?.state = newState
        })
    }
}
// MARK: Listener
extension CounterViewModel {
    fileprivate final class Listener: CounterStateChangeListener, @unchecked Sendable {
        fileprivate struct Forwarder {
            typealias OnStateChange = @Sendable (CounterState) -> Void
            private let onStateChange: OnStateChange
            init(_ onStateChange: @escaping OnStateChange) {
                self.onStateChange = onStateChange
            }
            fileprivate func forward(_ state: CounterState) {
                self.onStateChange(state)
            }
        }
        private var forwarder: Forwarder?
        init() {}
        fileprivate func add(forwarder: Forwarder) {
            self.forwarder = forwarder
        }
        // MARK: CounterStateChangeListener
        func onStateChange(state: CounterState) {
            forwarder?.forward(state)
        }
    }
}
// MARK: @dynamicMemberLookup
extension CounterViewModel {
    public subscript<Subject>(dynamicMember keyPath: KeyPath<CounterState, Subject>) -> Subject {
        self.state[keyPath: keyPath]
    }
}
// MARK: Forward Actions from view to model (Rust)
extension CounterViewModel {
    public func incrementButtonTapped() {
        model.incrementButtonTapped()
    }
    public func decrementButtonTapped() {
        model.decrementButtonTapped()
    }
    public func resetButtonTapped() {
        model.resetButtonTapped()
    }
}
```

Using `Counter`, `CounterState`, `CounterStateChangeListener` generated by UniFFI (via `lera`).

#### Run it

```sh
just example::apple::app::build-and-run
```

#### No retain cycles

Of course I've verified that there are no retain cycles between Swift and Rust, all classes deinit as expected, even when there is a background task running, so no memory leaks introduced.

## Kotlin Side

Android/Kotlin works! Take a look at [`example/android`](example/android)

### App demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e14a029-8dab-490a-91a5-f4a2e9bfee96

A simple Android app can be found in [`example/android/app`](example/android/app), which uses a kotlin package built by `lera` as a local dependency.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun CounterScreen(
    counterViewModel: CounterViewModel = viewModel()
) {
    val counterUiState by counterViewModel.uiState.collectAsState()

    Column(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxSize()
            .padding(16.dp),
        verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center,
        horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally
    ) {
        Text(
            text = "Count: ${counterUiState.count}",
            style = MaterialTheme.typography.displayLarge,
            textAlign = TextAlign.Center
        )

        Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(32.dp))

        Row(
            modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth(),
            horizontalArrangement = Arrangement.SpaceEvenly
        ) {
            Button(
                onClick = { counterViewModel.decrementButtonTapped() }
            ) {
                Text("−")
            }

            Button(
                onClick = { counterViewModel.resetButtonTapped() }
            ) {
                Text("Reset")
            }

            Button(
                onClick = { counterViewModel.incrementButtonTapped() }
            ) {
                Text("+")
            }
        }

        Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(16.dp))

        if (counterUiState.isAutoIncrementing) {
            Text(
                text = "Counter is being incremented automatically every ${counterUiState.autoIncrementIntervalMs}ms",
                textAlign = TextAlign.Center,
                modifier = Modifier.padding(horizontal = 16.dp, vertical = 8.dp)
            )
            Button(onClick = { counterViewModel.stopAutoIncrementingButtonTapped() }) {
                Text("Stop Auto")
            }
        } else {
            Text(
                text = "Automatic increment of the counter is stopped",
                textAlign = TextAlign.Center,
                modifier = Modifier.padding(horizontal = 16.dp, vertical = 8.dp)
            )
            Button(onClick = { counterViewModel.startAutoIncrementingButtonTapped() }) {
                Text("Start Auto")
            }
        }
    }
}

```

#### Run it

First build kotlin package with `lera` using `just`:

```sh
just example::android::build-package-and-app
```

Then open [`example/android/app`](example/android/app) with Android Studio and run the app.

### Kotlin generated by `lera`

```kotlin
fun `newDefaultCounterState`(): CounterState {
            return FfiConverterTypeCounterState.lift(
    uniffiRustCall() { _status ->
    UniffiLib.uniffi_counters_fn_func_new_default_counter_state(

        _status)
}
    )
}

class CounterViewModel(
    state: CounterState = newDefaultCounterState()
) : androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel() {

    private val listener = Listener()
    private val model = Counter(state, listener)
    private val _uiState = kotlinx.coroutines.flow.MutableStateFlow(state)
    val uiState: kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlow<CounterState> =
        _uiState.asStateFlow()

    init {
        listener.addForwarder { newState ->
            _uiState.value = newState
        }
    }


    fun incrementButtonTapped() {
        model.incrementButtonTapped()
    }


    fun decrementButtonTapped() {
        model.decrementButtonTapped()
    }


    fun resetButtonTapped() {
        model.resetButtonTapped()
    }


    fun startAutoIncrementingButtonTapped() {
        model.startAutoIncrementingButtonTapped()
    }


    fun stopAutoIncrementingButtonTapped() {
        model.stopAutoIncrementingButtonTapped()
    }


    override fun onCleared() {
        super.onCleared()
        listener.clear()
    }

    private inner class Listener : CounterStateChangeListener {
        private var forwarder: ((CounterState) -> Unit)? = null

        fun addForwarder(forwarder: (CounterState) -> Unit) {
            this.forwarder = forwarder
        }

        fun clear() {
            forwarder = null
        }

        override fun onStateChange(state: CounterState) {
            forwarder?.invoke(state)
        }
    }
}
```

`lera` use [askama (.rinja) templates](https://github.com/askama-rs/askama) to generate [`@Observable`](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/observation/observable()>) Swift Viewmodels which work in SwiftUI and `ViewModel()` classes in Kotlin with [`MutableStateFlow` properties](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-mutable-state-flow/)

This is done using several layers of "metaprogramming", Rust code ([procmacros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html)) generating UniFFI compatible Rust code which generates Swift and Kotlin bindings, and Rust code using Swift/Kotlin-templates generating Swift/Kotlin code using the Swift/Kotlin bindings.

## High level description

1. You write your (view)model and your state and mark which methods you wanna export, using `#[lera::model(state = CounterState)]`, `#[lera::state]` and `#[lera::api]`. These procmacros will expand into `#[uniffi:Object]`, `#[uniffi:Record]` and `#[uniffi:export]`, but with quite a bit of functionality. The `#[lera::model(state = FooState)]` gives the Rust struct two fields `state: Arc<RwLock<FooState>` and `state_change_listener: Arc<dyn FooListenerTrait>`. It also generates this constructor and methods:

```rust
pub trait LeraModel {
    type State: ModelState;
    type Listener: StateChangeListener<State = Self::State>;
    fn new(state: Self::State, listener: Self::Listener) -> Arc<Self>;
    fn access<R: Clone>(&self, access: impl FnOnce(Self::State) -> R) -> R;
    fn mutate<R>(&self, mutate: impl FnOnce(&mut Self::State) -> R) -> R;
    fn notify_state_change(&self, new_state: Self::State);
}
```

It generates a UniFFI exported listener trait for you and sets up bridging from it to:

```rust
pub trait StateChangeListener: Send + Sync + 'static {
    type State: ModelState;
    fn on_state_change(&self, new_state: Self::State);
}

```

2. Lera vendors a Rust build binary for Swift, which compiles Rust code (`cargo build`), runs bindgen (`uniffi_bindgen::bindings::generate_swift_bindings`), and builds an xcframework. It vendors a similar build binary for Kotlin.
3. Lera then generates Swift and Kotlin ViewModels, which wraps the model object, and a listener class and implements the callback interface which updates state in FFI land whenever it changes in Rust land. Lera write code which forwards all methods declared in `#[lera::api]` from the ViewModel (generated by lera) to the model (generated by UniFFI (via Lera)). On the Swift side it also implements `@dynamicMemberLookup` so that you need not write `viewModel.state.count`, you can just write `viewModel.count` (must like Rusts `Deref` trait!).

# Samples

Lera optionally integrates with a tiny sampling framework to generate test/demo values for your state types. This is useful for previews, fixtures, and for generating platform-side lists of sample states for rapid UI iteration.

> [!NOTE]
> Samples are **deterministic** (unlike [Dummy](https://crates.io/crates/dummy) / [Fake](https://crates.io/crates/fake) crates)

There are two pieces:

-   Trait and core impls: `samples_core::Samples` defines how to enumerate a small set of representative values for a type (e.g., integers, strings, collections). Many Rust standard/container types already implement it.
-   Derive and field customization: `samples_derive::Samples` derives `Samples` for your struct by combining field samples. You can override per-field samples using a `#[samples(...)]` attribute.

By default, lera does not force your state to implement `Samples`. You opt in per state.

## Opting in for a state

Annotate your state with `#[lera::state(samples)]` to:

-   Derive `samples_derive::Samples` for the type.
-   Export an FFI helper `new_<state>_samples(n: u8) -> Vec<State>` so Swift/Kotlin can request up to `n` samples.

Example: when all fields are already sampleable

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Default, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
#[lera::state(samples)]
pub struct ManualOnlyCounterState {
    pub count: i64,
}
```

## Custom samples

Sometimes a field's type doesn't implement `Samples`. You can still make the struct sampleable by providing explicit sample values for that field using `#[samples(...)]` on the field. Lera's derive supports two forms per field:

1. Direct literals/expressions

```rust
#[samples([value1, value2, value3])]
```

2. Expressions validated and constructed via a function path
   Optionally you can pass the values through a validation function

```rust
#[samples([value1, value2] -> path::to_fn)]
```

The `path::to_fn` **must** be a `const fn` that returns `Result<Type, E>` or `Type` (if you `panic!` in your validation). The derive will:

-   Validate at compile time that `path::to_fn(input)` is `Ok(_)`; if it's `Err(_)`, compilation fails with a clear message. This protects you from shipping bad sample values.
-   Construct the field value at runtime using `match path::to_fn(input) { Ok(v) => v, Err(_) => unreachable!(...) }` (the `Err` path is unreachable because of the compile-time check).

Complete example with a non-sampleable field type:

```rust
// Can optionally `#[derive(Samples)]`
pub struct Interval { ms: u64 }

impl Interval {
    pub const fn const_try_from(value: u64) -> Result<Self, &'static str> {
        if value == 0 { Err("Interval must be non-zero") } else { Ok(Interval { ms: value }) }
    }
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]
#[lera::state(samples)]
pub struct CounterState {
    pub count: i64,
    pub is_auto_incrementing: bool,
    #[samples([500, 1000] -> Interval::const_try_from)]
    pub auto_increment_interval_ms: Interval,
}
```

Here, `Interval` does not implement `Samples`, but `CounterState` still can, thanks to the field-level `#[samples(...)]` attribute.

## How derived Samples are combined

For a struct, the derive gathers a short list of candidate values per field and combines them:

-   Single-field struct: iterates the field's samples directly.
-   Up to 8 fields: uses a Cartesian product (iproduct) across the candidate lists.
-   More than 8 fields: uses an index-based product to avoid combinatorial explosion in codegen size.

If any field yields no candidates, the final iterator is empty.

## Usage on Swift/Kotlin side
Here is how you can use these samples to power e.g. SwiftUI previews:

```swift
#Preview {
	VStack {
		ForEach(CounterViewModel.samples(n: 3)) {
			CounterView(model: $0)
		}
	}
}
```

The static function `CounterViewModel.samples(n:)` is being generated by Lera for
you if your state is marked `#[lera::state(samples)]`. It creates **at most** `n`
many `CounterState`s (using `sample_vec` in Rust land) and initializes
ViewModels from them. 

> [!NOTE]
> SwiftUI previews **just work** in Xcode 26, due to improvements to previews.
> This was not the case for earlier versions of Xcode.

## API surface recap

-   Rust side:

    -   `#[lera::state(samples)]` opt-in for state-level samples and export of `new_<state>_samples(n)`.
    -   `#[samples([...])]` or `#[samples([... ] -> path::to_fn)]` per-field overrides.
    -   `samples_core::Samples::sample_vec_n(n)` and `::sample_vec()` return up to `n` or 255 samples, respectively.

-   Swift/Kotlin side:
    -   The exported `new_<state>_samples(n)` makes a Vec of sample states available to the platform via FFI when `samples` is enabled on the state.

## Notes and tips

-   Keep samples small. The derive limits and patterns aim for fast, deterministic sets—not exhaustive testing.
-   Use the `-> path::to_fn` form for smart constructors and validation. It must return `Result<FieldType, E>`; `E` only needs `Debug`.
-   You can mix direct values and validated values across fields.
-   If you omit `#[lera::state(samples)]`, your state will still work in lera; it just won't implement `Samples` or export the FFI helper.

_Lera_ is a Swedish 🇸🇪 word meaning literally _"clay"_, however, it is short for two heteronyms: 🇸🇪 model-lera (verb) and 🇸🇪 modellera (noun), meaning "to model" and "modelling clay" respectively. So with _lera_ I mean both the verb and the noun! You model... ViewModels, using `lera` as modelling clay!
